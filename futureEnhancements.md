1. Engineer More Powerful Features
This is where you'll likely see the biggest improvements. Your current features are great, but adding more context can make the model much smarter.

Vegas Betting Lines: This is the single most impactful data you can add. Sportsbooks are excellent at projecting game outcomes.

Game Total (Over/Under): Higher totals mean more expected points and more touchdown opportunities.

Team Implied Total: You can calculate this from the spread and the game total. A team expected to score 28 points will have more TD chances than a team expected to score 17.

You can get this data from the nfl_data_py library by using nfl.import_odds_data().

Advanced Red Zone Stats: Go beyond simple counts. Calculate a player's Red Zone Opportunity Shareâ€”the percentage of their team's total red zone rushes and targets that they received. A player getting 75% of his team's red zone carries is a much better bet than a player getting 25%.

Opponent Strength vs. Position: Instead of just using the opponent's total TDs allowed, get more specific.

Calculate how many receiving touchdowns the opponent allows specifically to WRs vs. TEs.

Calculate how many rushing touchdowns the opponent allows to RBs.

This tells you if an opponent has a specific weakness you can target (e.g., they are great against the run but terrible at covering tight ends).

Time-Decayed Averages: Your current rolling averages treat a game from 3 weeks ago the same as last week's game. Use an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (.ewm()) instead. This puts more weight on more recent performances, which are often more predictive.

df['ewm_carries'] = df.groupby('player_display_name')['carries'].transform(lambda x: x.shift(1).ewm(span=3, adjust=False).mean())

2. Experiment with Advanced Models & Tuning
Your Random Forest is a solid baseline, but other models might capture the patterns in the data better.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Scikit-learn's RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for your Random Forest (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_leaf, max_features). This can often squeeze out a few extra percentage points of accuracy.

Try Gradient Boosting Models: Models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are the modern standard for tabular data and often outperform Random Forest. They are powerful and very good at finding complex relationships in the data. LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency.

3. Implement More Robust Validation
A single validation year is good, but you can build more confidence in your model's performance.

Walk-Forward Validation: Create a loop that simulates how you'd use the model over time.

Train on 2021 -> Predict on 2022

Train on 2021-2022 -> Predict on 2023

Train on 2021-2023 -> Predict on 2024

Averaging the performance across these seasons gives you a much more reliable estimate of your model's real-world accuracy.

Profitability Analysis: Convert your model's probabilities into American odds and compare them to actual sportsbook odds for "Anytime Touchdown Scorer" props. You can backtest to see if your model would have been profitable by betting on players where it identified a significant edge over the market.

4. Improve the Workflow
Automate It: Turn your script into something you can run with one command each week. It should automatically pull the latest stats, find the upcoming week's schedule, and generate a clean list of predictions.

Create a Dashboard: Instead of printing to the console, output your predictions to a CSV or a simple HTML file. You could even use a library like Streamlit or Dash to build a simple, interactive web app to explore the results.
